Introduction:

America has been struggling with this issue for many years now. A recent documentary (released in May 2021) by HBO “The crime of the century” shed a new light on this crisis and talked about the role of the Sackler family which got us interested in the topic.Through this exploration and analysis we plan to find answers to the following:

Question 1: What are the drug trends and variants available and how have they been shifted over the past few years?

Question 2: What demographics were affected the most by drug abuse and the reason behind them?

Question 3: How has drug abuse impacted people’s health and lives over the years? What is the mortality due to drug overdose?

Question 4: What are the different protective measures taken to prevent drug abuse in the future?

Proposed Data Sources for use:
1. https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/8636/datadocumentation
This dataset particularly contains the information of incidents registered for drug abuse, at what age it started, how was the person been demographically involved and their diagnosis. (Question 1 & Question 2)

2. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm
This dataset can be used to analyse the impact of drugs on people’s health and mortality rate of the country. (Question 3)

3. NCIPC Opioid Funding (cdc.gov)
This website mentions the funds released by different state governments in the US to mitigate this crisis and the steps being taken to resolve it. (Question 4)
